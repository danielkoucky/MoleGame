## User Experience (UX)

### Client Goals

- As a first time visitor, the game should immediately engage through its visuals, drawing me into the gameplay.

- As a first time user, I'd like a game that is responsive to different devices and easy to navigate.

- As a first time visitor, the game clearly communicate how to play it through the instructions section and be able to choose difficulty options.

- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to play different times and be able to monitor my performance and check my score.

- As a frequent visitor, I have the ability to customise the auditory environment using the music button. I can also interact with the footer by either showing it or hiding it.

- Moreover, as a frequent visitor, I want to retain the autonomy to reset the game whenever they wish.

### Colour Scheme

- The game's colour palette is derived from nature's own hues, encompassing tones of greens, red and yellow.
- Black typography to ensures readability, while white spaces create a balanced visual experience.
- Buttons are adorned with a clean white with hover effect created of green tones, contributing to the overall harmonious design.

### Typography

I used three fonts for this project:

- Leckerli One, for the logo.
- Handjet, for the buttons, main headlines and scoreboard.
- Sans-serif for the rest of text in body.

### Images and Background

- The background of leaves was picked to give a feeling of a simple nature vibe. This choice aligns with the game's concept, as the mole's holes are naturally found in soil. The background seamlessly complements the gameplay while incorporating white spaces strategically to avoid overwhelming/distracting users.

- Other in-game images were also chosen for their simplicity and nature-inspired aesthetic. These visuals introduce a touch of uplifting emotional response that resonates both with children and adults, maintaining a level of appeal across ages.

- For references of these images can be found in credits below.

### Style

- The style I chose is very minimalistic with an emphasis on clean design and simplicity. There are wide usage of white spaces.
- To maintain the child-friendly theme, I incorporated rounded corners for boxes and containers, mirroring the corners found in many real-life memory cards designed for children. Consistently applying this rounded corner pattern across the page ensures design harmony and a cohesive look that ties all elements together seamlessly.

### Icons

- The setting buttons have icons. Each icon was deliberately chosen based on its clear and intuitive meaning, ensuring universal understanding for all users.

### Sound effects and music

- To further capture the essence of a children's game, I incorporated button click sounds reminiscent of those found in physical toys.
- This addition aims to evoke a sense of familiarity and playfulness, enhancing the overall experience.
- Furthermore, when interacting with the moles, a distinct hammer hitting sound confirms accurate clicks on the intended target. Conversely, clicking on the incorrect area, symbolized by the rabbit, triggers a losing sound effect, indicating an unsuccessful move.

## Features

The website consists of two main pages: a home page and a games page. Each page on the website is designed to be responsive to various screen sizes.

### Existing Features

A website has favicon displayed in the browser tab.

![favicon](https://github.com/zaicodes/whack-a-mole/blob/main/documentation/favicon.png)

The home page features the site's logo, an image, and two buttons. One of these buttons provides access to the instructions, while the other simply reads "Enter," allowing users to start the game.

![home](https://github.com/zaicodes/whack-a-mole/blob/main/documentation/home.png)

Once inside the game page, the site has a title, prominently located at the left corner of the page. This title also serves as a clickable link, directing users back to the home page.

![header](https://github.com/zaicodes/whack-a-mole/blob/main/documentation/header.png)

It consists also of game settings with 4 buttons for user to control. reset button to reset the game at any point, music button to control the music, instruction button to reveal the instructions and finally a leaderboard button to display the top 10 scores.

![game-settings](https://github.com/zaicodes/whack-a-mole/blob/main/documentation/game-settings.png)

Before the game start, the user will be prompted to enter their name and submit it so it can be shown in the leaderboard once the round is finished.

![username](https://github.com/zaicodes/whack-a-mole/blob/main/documentation/username.png)

Subsequently, the user will be presented with a selection of difficulty levels to choose from, including options for easy, medium, and hard.

![difficulty](https://github.com/zaicodes/whack-a-mole/blob/main/documentation/difficulty.png)

Also, within the game page, there exists a leaderboard accessible by clicking the "Leaderboard" button within the game settings. This leaderboard will display the top 10 scores achieved by players.

![leaderboard](https://github.com/zaicodes/whack-a-mole/blob/main/documentation/leaderboard.png)

furthermore, there is a game board with an interactive mole that users must whack with their mouse or touch on mobile devices. Also, a rabbit that appears where users must avoid.

![game-board](https://github.com/zaicodes/whack-a-mole/blob/main/documentation/game-board.png)

There is a score displayed at the bottom of the game board while they are actively playing.

![score](https://github.com/zaicodes/whack-a-mole/blob/main/documentation/score.png)

The site also includes a hidden footer that can be revealed by clicking a button. Once the footer is pulled up, the button transforms into a "Push Down" option, providing users with the ability to easily show or hide the footer as needed.

![pull-push-footer](https://github.com/zaicodes/whack-a-mole/blob/main/documentation/pull-push-footer.png)

Additionally, the game includes two exciting features one of them is the celebratory effects in the form of confetti ribbons that appear when the user win the game.

The second one is screenshot feature which becomes available when the user successfully wins the game. The user can click on the "Screenshot" option to capture the screen, after which they have the choice to either download it or click the 'X' to cancel. If they choose to download, the screenshot is saved on their computer for easy access.

### Features left to implement

In the future, I'd like to introduce the following features, some of these were suggested by my mentor but I couldn't implement them:

- Exploring the possibility of transforming the game into a multiplayer experience, enabling teams to participate, thus enhancing the overall enjoyment.

- Developing distinct backend databases to store scores, facilitating users in comparing their performance against other players and across various difficulty levels.

- Sharing the game's screenshot with friends on social media.

## Accessibility

I have been diligent in my coding efforts to make the website as user-friendly and accessible as possible. This has been accomplished through the following means:

- Utilizing semantic HTML for a structured page layout.
- Implementing ALT tags for hyperlinks, icons, and images to provide descriptive text alternatives.
- Incorporating hover effects on all buttons to clearly indicate to users when they are interacting with a button.
- Selecting a sans-serif font for paragraphs to enhance readability, particularly for individuals with dyslexia.
- Ensuring that there is adequate colour contrast throughout the site, making content more discernible and accessible.
