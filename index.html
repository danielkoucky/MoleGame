                <h1>Welcome to Whack A Mole</h1>
                <h2>Objectives:</h2>
                <p>
                    Your objective is to score as many points as possible by whacking moles that pop up from their holes. 
                    Each successful hit on a mole will earn you 5 points.
                </p>
                <h2>Avoid Hitting Rabbits:</h2>
                <p>
                    Avoid clicking on rabbits! If you hit a rabbit, your score will be penalized, and you will lose the game.
                    The game will continue for a set duration ( 30 seconds).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Whack as many moles as you can while avoiding rabbits to achieve the highest score possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hit the reset button to restart the game at any point and the play/stop music button to toggle the
                    game's music.
                    If you need a refresh on the rules, then click the instructions button.
                </p>
                <h2>Tips:</h2>
                <p>
                    Stay focused and be quick with your mouse clicks to whack the moles before they disappear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be patient and avoid hasty clicks, especially when a rabbit appears. 
                    It's better to miss a mole than to hit a rabbit and lose points.
